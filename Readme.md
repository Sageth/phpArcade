## Description
This is a Responsive arcade script written in PHP that is -- in spirit -- based on the old (no longer 
supported or maintained) version of GameSiteScript 4. Nearly all of the code has been rewritten for 
better adherence to new coding standards.  

## Features (screenshots below)
* Add/edit pages via GUI
* Add/edit games manually
* Custom languages possible via .PO files, English default
* Customizable theme modules and uploading
* Database-driven design, including stored procedures and indexed queries
* External email support (e.g. [Google Apps for Work](https://goo.gl/S3SgCr), Gmail)
* HTML5 games and other custom code implementations
* Internal high score system for some game types, primarily ibPro v2
* Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4-based themes
* RSS Feeds
* Supports PHP7!
* User administration and profiles

## Additional Notes
* The examples provided in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Sageth/phpArcade/wiki) are for CentOS 6 using non-default
repositories. This code has not been tested on Apache. It may work with some basic .htaccess conversions.
* This code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sageth/phpArcade) and on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Sageth/phparcade).

## Supported/Tested Platforms:
* Please review the [.travis.yml](https://github.com/Sageth/phparcade/blob/master/.travis.yml) file in the `master` branch.
* Please note that MySQL is not tested and is not officially supported, however, it _probably_ works with MySQL 5.7+
